# Sentiment_Prediction_RNN

The problem of `sentiment classification` has received a lot of attention of late. 
* It finds applications in the fields of business intelligence, recommender systems (so as to be able to understand the
sentiment in a userâ€™s feedback), in online surveys that have `natural language sentences` as responses,
message filtering, assessing movie review polarity, among others.

* Here I have implemented a  **recurrent neural network(RNN)** that performs **sentiment analysis**.
